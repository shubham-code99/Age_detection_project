# Age_detection_project

Images data was to big to get uploaded ...even after zipping the folder it was no comming under the file size.

So....

here the 1st program i.e. store images is used to convert the image into numpy and store them in single file that is data.

that data file with images as numpy is used in another program age_detect2 where KNN algorithm is implemented on data and also the input in taken there only and prediction is done on them.
